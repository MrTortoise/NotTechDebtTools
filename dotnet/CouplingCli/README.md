# dotnet project

should jsut run without anything crazy

uses git on command line though

the command to run looks liek this

` dotnet run ~/g/tech_debt/repos/di-account-management-frontend 2022-01-01 ~/g/tech_debt/dotnet/CouplingCli/analysis`

The first folder is a directory path containing a git repo
the second is a date in yyyy-mm-dd
last is folder to write the output to

should work with absolute paths - haven't tested it though because cba writing a full one out.
