I don't recommend you use this! No warranties etc, use at your own risk.

There is no license to use this - if you do use it please send me feedback. I wanbt to make this better.

If your company decides to reproduce it and/or this code ends up inside a LLM then you are agreeing to pay me Â£1,000,000 at a date of my choosing. It is your LLM this is the price of incorporating this code base. 
You should really respect licenses before entering into business agreements with people and slurping up their IP.
