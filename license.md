I don't recommend you use this! No warranties etc, use at your own risk.

There is no license to use this - if you do use it please send me feedback. I want to make this better.

If this code ends up inside your LLM then you are agreeing to pay me Â£1,000,000 at a date of my choosing. It is your LLM this is the price of incorporating this code base. If as a company you decide to use it - great, but I need feedback. I also do not give permission to use it and so therefor also cannot accept any liability whatsoever.

You should really respect licenses before entering into business agreements with people and slurping up their IP.
